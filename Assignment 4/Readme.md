# Assignment 4
This assignment is mainly focused on implementing CPS functions, working with lazy lists, and solve logic programming problems.  
* **CPS Functions:** Implement ```pipe$```, a CPS-based function composition tool, and demonstrate its equivalence to standard pipe.  
* **Lazy Lists:** Develop procedures for reducing values in lazy lists, creating lazy lists with incremental reductions, and generating lazy approximations to Ï€.
* **Logic Programming:** Perform unification tasks, and implement pathfinding, edge reversal, and node degree calculations in directed graphs using Prolog.
