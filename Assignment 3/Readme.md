# Assignment 3
This assignment focuses on enhancing the L5 language by introducing new types and type predicates to create L5v2. The assignment involves extending the language syntax to support basic types like any and never, and complex types such as union, intersection, and difference. 

Additionally, it requires implementing type predicates and updating type checking functions to accommodate these new features. This includes modifying existing syntax and functions to support type operations and predicates in the new L5v2 language.
